*** HOW TO APPLY THESE CHANGES ***

1) Create a new branch:
   git checkout -b feature/nws-provider

2) Copy files into your repo at the same relative paths:
   - xtrn/syncWXremix/providers/nws.js
   - README_NWS_ADDENDUM.md

3) Edit xtrn/syncWXremix/weather.js:
   - load("providers/nws.js");
   - Read modopts: provider, latitude, longitude, user_agent, station
   - If provider === "nws": data = NWSProvider.load(lat, lon, ua, station);
   - Pass data through convertNWS() (see README_NWS_ADDENDUM.md) to render with your existing panels.

4) Update modopts.ini (system-wide or module-specific) with:
   [syncWXremix]
   provider = nws
   latitude = <your-lat>
   longitude = <your-lon>
   user_agent = Retro Mafia BBS syncWXremix (sysop: <email>)

5) Test from your BBS:
   - Run the door; verify current conditions, forecast periods, and alerts display.
   - Try with/without `station=` to confirm auto-pick of nearest station.
   - Check that no external icon URL is used (ANSI iconset only).

6) Commit and push:
   git add xtrn/syncWXremix/providers/nws.js README_NWS_ADDENDUM.md
   git commit -m "feat(nws): add National Weather Service provider and config docs"
   git push origin feature/nws-provider

If you want a ready-to-apply unified diff against your current tree, paste your
`xtrn/syncWXremix/weather.js` here and I'll generate a precise patch.
